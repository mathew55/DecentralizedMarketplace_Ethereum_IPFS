# Decentralized Marketplace Using Ethereum & IPFS
The Decentralized marketplace is an application built on top of the Ethereum & Interplanetary File System (IPFS) to create a new decentralized, peer-to-peer platform that aims to bring together buyers and sellers under one umbrella.

#Features:
<p>o	Front-end for buyers and sellers which can talk to the Ethereum blockchain and use smart contract functionality to add to cart and buy the products.</p>
<p>o	IPFS file storage support to the system to store all the metadata which is otherwise expensive to store on the blockchain.</p>
<p>o	Escrow functionality to handle disputes between the buyer and the seller. The funds when buying a product will be first placed in escrow until the buyer and seller come into an agreement.</p>
<p>o	Bridge server for filtering and categorizing of the products which enhances the overall user experience of the system.</p>
